/*The throw keyword is used to throw an exception from within a method.
 * Throw Keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.
 * we can throw either checked Exception(or) unchecked exceptions by using throw keyword
 * 
 * The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exception(User-Defined Exceptions). 
If we want to create user-defined exceptions by extending the exception class.
    The syntax is:
Class user-defined exception extends Exception
Class wronginput extends Exception
Here wronginput is user-defined exception



 * 
 * Do you know that a programmer can create a new exception and throw it explicitly?
 *  These exceptions are known as user-defined exceptions. In order to throw user defined exceptions, throw keyword is being used.
