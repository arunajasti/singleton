/*in java 8 the interface changes
Interface can’t have static methods but in java 8 it is possible
static methods or default mehods in interface we should implement in interface these methods cannot be overrideen in subclasses.
Calling an static interface method doesn't require to be implemented by any class. 
Surely, this happens because the same rules for static methods in superclasses applies for static methods on interfaces.
Because static methods cannot be overridden in subclasses, and hence they cannot be abstract. And all methods in an interface are default abstract.
