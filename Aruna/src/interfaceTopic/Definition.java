/*Interface looks like an a class but it is not class.Because
 * Inteface has only ABSTRACT METHODS(Without body).The methods can be declared as public and Abstract
 * Interface fields are public,static ,final by default
 * we cannot create the instance(object) of Interface class (same as Abstraction)
 Interface supports Multiple inheritance .
 
 A class can  extends another class(by using inheritance) here subclass can extend only one superclass.here multiple inheritance is not possible
 
 A class can  implements an interface(by  interface using IMPLEMENTS keyword )//here a class implements Multiple of Interface.Here multiple Inheritance possible
 
 An Interface extends another Interface//here one interface extend any multiple interface by using Extend Keyword.Here also Multiple Inheritance is  Possible
