/*Type of relationship always makes to understand how to reuse the feature from one class to another class. 
 * In java programming we have three types of relationship they are.
 adv: code reusebility
Is-A Relationship: Inheritance
Has-A Relationship:Composition or Aggregation
Uses-A Relationship

Is-A relationship(Arithmatic & calculation programs)create an object of subclass to access the superclass methods & variables
In Is-A relationship one class is obtaining the features of another class by using inheritance concept with extends keywords

In Has-A relationship (Sample1 & SampleMain check)(create an object of one class in another class )

an object of one class is created as data member in another class the relationship between these two classes is Has-A.
 //using instance variables that are references to other objects. 
here i create the object Sample1 as data member in  SampleMain class

Uses-A relationship
A method of one class is using an object of another class the relationship between these two classes is known as Uses-A relationship.
