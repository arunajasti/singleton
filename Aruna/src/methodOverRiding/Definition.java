/*method overridding/Dynamic binding/Run-time Polymorphism
 * 
 *  Method overriding(happens in Inheritance)&  Constructor Overriding never happens in JAVA 
 * because constructor have same name class name so superclass constructor have superclass name
 * subclass constuctor have subconstructor class name.so that's why Constructor Overriding never happens in JAVA 
 * 
 * overriding method is nothing but two(or) more  methods have same name and same parameters in different class.
 one method in parent class & other method in subclass.
  subclass method overrides the super class method.
 .Overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided its parent class.
