/*java passes only pass by value not pass by ref
 * The main difference is 
 * when we pass by reference we are handing in our only copy of the variable, 
 * and the function directly modifies that variable,where as
 *  when we pass by value we have another variable that points at the other variable, 
 * so basically two copies of the same variable, and only the copy is modified( leaving our original unchanged.)doesnot affect originals
