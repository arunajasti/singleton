package thisandsuper;
/*this and super are two special keywords in Java, 
 * which is used to represent current instance of a class(this) and it's super class(super)

You can use this() to call no argument constructor(or) with argument constructor of same class, 
//while super() to call no argument or default constructor of parent class.

Before seeing difference between this and super keywords in Java, let's see some similarities between them :
1) Both this and super are NON STATIC and can not be used in static context, 
which means you can not use this and super keyword inside main method in Java. 

2) Both this and super can be used in constructor chaining to call another constructor e.g. 
this() and super() respectively calls no argument constructor of child and parent class.

3)Can you use both this() and super() in a Constructor?
NO, because both super() and this() must be first statement inside a constructor. Hence we cannot use them together.
