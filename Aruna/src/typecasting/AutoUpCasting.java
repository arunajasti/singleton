//Assigning one data type to another or one object to another is known as casting. Java supports two types of casting – data type casting and object casting.

//Conditions of assigning objects of different classes one to another
//1.Same class objects can be assigned one to another 
//2.Subclass object can be assigned to a super class object and this casting is done implicitly. This is known as upcasting (upwards in the hierarchy from subclass to super class).
